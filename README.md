  <summary><h3> 🧑‍💻 ntuanvu89's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  <p>
I began my programming journey at the age of 15 when I entered high school. The first language I encountered was C++, and the algorithms and data structures I was taught in school helped me greatly in competitive programming contests. I joined my school's informatics team and competed in the national informatics competition for outstanding students. However, I fell short and only received consolation prizes for two consecutive years, which remains one of my biggest regrets from high school.

Upon entering university, I chose FPT University Hanoi as the next stop in my journey. I received a 100% tuition scholarship, which became a great support throughout my studies. During this time, I found JS Club (Japanese Software Club), a club that helped me mature greatly in learning new technologies. I learned to build a website system, develop an online game that attracted many players, and study new programming languages. JS Club felt like home, and I loved the people there. Besides, throughout my time at university, I participated in various programming competitions such as ICPC, the National Student Olympiad in Informatics, FTalent Code, and more. These experiences helped me maintain the skills I had developed in high school.

During my university years, I worked in several roles: as a freelance algorithm programmer, an algorithms tutor, and as an intern from the beginning of my second year.

    A challenging and rewarding journey 🤩
